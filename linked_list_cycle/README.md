# linked_list_cycle
For this interview practice algorithm, there is a singly linked list that may or may not contain a cycle.

[Linked List Cycle](/linked_list_cycle/0-check_cycle.c)
* Write a function in C `int check_cycle(listing_t *list)` that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it:
  * Returns `0` if there is no cycle, `1` if there is a cycle
  * Only the following functions are allowed: `write`, `printf`, `putchar`, `puts`, `malloc`, `free`
