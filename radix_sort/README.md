# radix_sort
This interview algorithm project sorts an array of ints with radix sort, which sorts by each digit.

[Radix Sort](/radix_sort/0-radix_sort.c)
* Write a function in C `void radix_sort(int *array, size_t size)` that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using Radix Sort.
  * implements the Least Significant Digit radix sort algorithm
  * the array can be assumed to only contain non-negative ints
  * you are allowed to use malloc and free for this task
  * the algorithm prints the array each time the significant digit is increased
